Animation Sequence

An animation sequence is described as a null pointer delimited list of addresses which point to frames.
This way, repetition of the same frames is allowed. Multiple objects can share the same animation sequence, and animation sequences can but switched at any time.

Ex. animation sequence

| Frame number | Address of frame |
-----------------------------------
|       0      |       0x01       |     <- Label points here (ex. ZOMBIE_WALK_AS)
|       1      |       0x0A       |
|       2      |       0x11       |
|       3      |       0x1A       |
|       4      |       0x21       |
|      N/A     |       0x00       |

Ex. code for animation controller

let a = animation_sequence_pointer;
let as = animation_start_pointer;

as, a = ZOMBIE_WALK_AS          // Set the sequence for next draw

some where in draw
:
:
do_animation(){
    a = a + 1;
    if *a == 0:
        a = as;
    else:
        sprite_pointer = *a;
}
